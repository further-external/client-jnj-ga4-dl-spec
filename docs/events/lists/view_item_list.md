# View Item (Product) List

Fire whenever a user sees multiple product links in a list that forward the user to the product detail page. 

This event should also be fired for the "Filter By Group" component when the list is initially displayed, or when a user applies a facet (but only when that component contains one or more products).

## Javascript Code

```js
// When:
// User sees multiple product links in a list that forward to a product detail page
// 'Filter By Group' component list is initially displayed or updated after a facet is applied, but only for products

// Code:
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ ecommerce: null });  // Clear the previous ecommerce object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: "view_item_list",
  ecommerce: {
    facets: "<facets>", // optional | string - double delimited (:)(~) | ex. category:skin_health~featured_as:best_seller	
    items: "<items>", // REQUIRED | array | ex. [{item_id: "070501110485", item_name: "Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream"}]	
    item_list_id: "<item_list_id>", // recommended | string | ex. 12345abcde12345
    item_list_name: "<item_list_name>", // recommended | string | ex. filter_by_group, recommended_products, recently_viewed_products
    list_type: "<list_type>", // optional | string | ex. cards, search_results	
    search_term: "<search_term>", // optional | string | ex. sunscreen
    search_type: "<search_type>", // optional | string | ex. site, filter_by_group
  }
});
```
