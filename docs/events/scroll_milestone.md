# Scroll Milestone

Fire when a user scrolls past a certain scroll depth. The built-in `scroll` event can be set up to automatically on 90% scroll depth, but this event will allow for more milestones to be recorded.

## Javascript Code

```js
// When:
// User scrolls past a certain scroll depth

// Code:
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ event_data: null });  // Clear the previous event_data object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'scroll_milestone',
  event_data: {
    milestone: '<milestone>' // REQUIRED | string | ex. 25, 50, 75
  }
});
```
