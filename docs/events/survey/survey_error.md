# Survey Error

Fire whenever a user unsuccessfully completes a survey. 

This is in contrast to [`complete_survey`](survey/complete_survey.md) which occurs when a submission succeeds.

## Javascript Code

```js
// When:
// User unsuccessfully completes a survey and survey input is not sucessfully received and processed. Contrasts survey_complete in which a submission is received and processed successfully. 

// Code:
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ event_data: null });  // Clear the previous event_data object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'survey_error',
  event_data: {
    error_message: '<error_message>', // REQUIRED | string | ex. Phone number should follow the format (xxx) xxx-xxxx, Must be a valid email address
    identifier: '<identifier>', // recommended | string | ex. cancel_subscription_flow, free_trial
    name: '<name>', // REQUIRED | string | ex. cancel_subscription_flow, free_trial
    type: '<type>', // REQUIRED | string | ex. survey, lead_generation
  }
});
```
