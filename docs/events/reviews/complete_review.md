# Review Complete

Fire whenever a user completes a review. 

An [item](/schemas/item) object should be included, but not as a separate property or array. The keys and values of the item should be rolled into the base object being pushed...hence the spread operator syntax used in the JS code below.

## Javascript Code

```js
// When:
// User completes a review

// Code:
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ event_data: null });  // Clear the previous event_data object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'review_complete',
  event_data: {
    rating: "<rating>", // REQUIRED | string | ex. 12345
    item_id: "<item_id>" // recommended | string | ex. 3
  }
});
```
