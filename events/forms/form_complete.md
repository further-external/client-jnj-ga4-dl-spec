# Form Complete

Fire whenever a user successfully completes a form. 

This event is fired when form input is successfully received and process. This is in contrast to `form_error` which occurs when a submission is attempted but an error occurs and the form input is not recieved and processed.

## Javascript Code

```js
// When:
// User successfully completes a form and data is received and processed

// Code:
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ event_data: null, user_data: null });  // Clear the previous event_data object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'form_complete',
  event_data: {
    identifier: '<identifier>', // recommended | string | ex. ecp_locator, free_trial	
    name: '<name>', // REQUIRED | string | ex. ecp_locator, free_trial	
    type: '<type>' // REQUIRED | string | ex. contact, lead_generation	
  },
  user_data: {
    user_id: '<user_id>', // optional | string | ex. 12345
    user_login_state: '<user_login_state>', // optional | string | ex. authenticated, anonymous	
    user_type: '<user_type>' // optional | string | ex. new, returning
    event_form_custkey: '<SFMC_CustomerKey>', // REQUIRED | string | ex. 12345...
    event_form_hashemail: '<HashedEmail>' // REQUIRED | string | ex. b642b4217b34b1e8d3bd915fc65c4452 (MD5)
  }
});
```

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

|name|string|required|The form human-readable name. This should be something that an analyst without a deep knowledge of the technical implementation of the site can easily identify the form with. It should be lowercase snake_case.|ecp_locator, free_trial|
|type|string|required|The form type. This will act as a filtering mechanism in reporting to enable analysts to view form droppoff funnels. It can also act as an internal aid in firing additional events if necessary. For instance, lead-generating forms require a `generate_lead` event to be fired alongside `form_complete`, and that could be written into the logic based upon this field.|contact, lead_generation|
