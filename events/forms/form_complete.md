# Form Complete

Fire whenever a user successfully completes a form. 

This event is fired when form input is successfully received and process. This is in contrast to `form_error` which occurs when a submission is attempted but an error occurs and the form input is not recieved and processed.

## Javascript Code

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ event_data: null, user_data: null });  // Clear the previous event_data object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'form_complete',
  event_data: {
    identifier: '<identifier>',
    name: '<name>',
    type: '<type>'
  },
  user_data: {
    user_id: '<user_id>',
    user_login_state: '<user_login_state>',
    event_form_custkey: '<SFMC_CustomerKey>',
    event_form_hashemail: '<HashedEmail>'
  }
});
```
