# View Search Results

Fire whenever a user views search results. This includes product searches, content searches, resource searches, etc. and does not require a search event to be fired prior to it.

This event should also be considered for the "Filter By Group" component if it is ever used to display anything but products. When used in this way, the search_term parameter would be `filter_by_group` as that component does not currently allow for a search_term to be entered by the user. If this case does arise, contact Search Discovery for additional information.
## Javascript Code

```js
// When:
// User views search results and does not require a search event to be fired previously

// Code:
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ event_data: null });  // Clear the previous event_data object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: "view_search_results",
  event_data: {
    facets: "<refinements>", // recommended | string - double delimited (:)(~) | ex. category:skin_health~featured_as:best_seller	
    number_of_items: "<number_of_items>", // recommended | integer | ex. 324
    search_term: "<search_term>", // REQUIRED | string | ex. sunscreen
    search_type: "<search_type>", // REQUIRED | string | ex. ecp_locator, filter_by_group,product, site	
  }
});
```
